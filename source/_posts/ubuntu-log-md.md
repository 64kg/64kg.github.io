# VLC

Although [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/) is most recommanded, my experience
with it sucks. Its last century style UI is unbearable. The most bizarre thing
is that every time you open it, there is a high probability that the audio and
picture will be separated: one window for video and one window for audio.

After searching for a long time, I finally found a solution
[here](https://askubuntu.com/a/1384279).

You have to change two settings in **Preference** (`Ctrl-P` to open it).
