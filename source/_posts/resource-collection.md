# Statistics

[Intuition: Exploration vs Exploitation](https://towardsdatascience.com/intuition-exploration-vs-exploitation-c645a1d37c7a)

Explanation to "exploration vs exploitation" trade off in reinforcement learning etc.

Introduction to three strategies for multi-armed bandit problem: $\varepsilon$-greedy, upper confidence bound, and Thompson sampling. The upper confidence bound strategy shows the trade off between exploration and exploitation.

[A Tutorial on Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02811)

A thorough introduction to Bayesian optimization.

[A Gentle Introduction to the BFGS Optimization Algorithm](https://machinelearningmastery.com/bfgs-optimization-in-python/)

Newton's method = second order optimization method, which uses Hessian matrix to determine both direction and step size to move.

Quasi Newton method, among which BFGS is the most popular, uses gradient to approximate inverse Hessian.

BFGS need to store the inverse Hessian, while L-BFGS only need to store a simplified matrix. This could come in handy when there are millions of parameters.


# Quantum chemistry

⭐ [Quantum computational chemistry](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.92.015003) ([书签版下载](/attach/ChemReview.pdf))

Intro to quantum computational chemistry, covering both classical computational chemistry and quantum version.

[An Introduction to Hartree-Fock Molecular Orbital Theory](http://vergil.chemistry.gatech.edu/notes/hf-intro/hf-intro.pdf)

Easy to read Hartree-Fock method introduction.

[Full vs. Limited Configuration Interaction](https://expchem3.com/theory/ltdci/)

Brief introduction to CI.

[OpenFermion-Psi4](https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion-Psi4)

An open source library for compiling and analyzing quantum algorithms which simulate fermionic systems. This plugin library allows the electronic structure package [Psi4](http://psicode.org/).

[“Second quantization” (the occupation-number representation)](http://physics.gu.se/~tfkhj/OsloSecondQuant.pdf)

Might be helpful.

[The Jordan-Wigner and Bravyi-Kitaev Transforms](https://quantumai.google/openfermion/tutorials/jordan_wigner_and_bravyi_kitaev_transforms)

Easy to read and understand. Part of the OpenFermion tutorial.

[What is static correlation ?](https://mattermodeling.stackexchange.com/a/4409)

Electronic configurations and static correlation.

# Physics

[Intuitive explanation for Liouville's theorem](https://www.quora.com/Dynamical-Systems/Dynamical-Systems-What-is-the-intuitive-explanation-for-Liouvilles-theorem)

Liouville's theorem can be thought of as conservation of information in classical mechanics. The analog to Liouville's theorem in quantum mechanics is unitarity.

# Python

[Python multiprocessing](https://zetcode.com/python/multiprocessing/)

An introductory tutorial to process-based parallelism in Python.

# HTML/CSS

[How to correctly position context menus using pure CSS](https://mionskowski.pl/positioning-a-context-menu-using-pure-css)

CSS code for correct position of a context menu.
